Use strong action verbs, quantify achievements where possible (without inventing numbers), use concise language, and focus on impact.

Highlight their unique strengths and what drives them.

Use engaging and professional language.
Synthesize information from the entire resume but avoid simply repeating it. Focus on the "why" behind their choices and experiences.
Imagine this is a brief personal introduction the candidate would give in a networking setting.
Data Mapping, Cleaning, and YAML Output: Map extracted and enhanced information to the YAML template. Perform data cleaning (standardizing dates, handling missing data). Output valid YAML.


Summarization and Objective: Provide a concise, impactful summary and rewrite the objective to be more compelling if needed.

No Fabrication: Do not invent information but enhance and present the candidate's actual experiences and achievements in the best possible light. Try to fill in the missing information as possible.

PAY ATTENTION, Quote all strings in the yaml output with double quotes. Use | for multiline strings and escape ':' s in the yaml output.
